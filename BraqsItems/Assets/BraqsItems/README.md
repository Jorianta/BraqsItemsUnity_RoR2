# Braq's Items
A big ol' mod adding a variety of new items. Currently just a handful designed to synergize with eachother.

## Tier 1
#### Accelerant
Increases explosion radius by 5% (+5% per stack).
#### Hundreds and Thousands
For each enemy you have hit, increase attack speed by 1% (+1% per stack) while that enemy lives.
#### Jumper Cables
On kill, fire chain lightning for 100% excess damage of the killing blow at 3 (+1 per stack) enemies within 12m (+3m per stack).
### Void
#### Sunken Chains
After kill, your next 2 (+1 per stack)attacks strike an additional time for up to %300 (+50% per stack) base damage, proportional to the amount of excess damage from the killing blow. Multiple bonuses can be applied at once. Corrupts all Jumper Cables.

## Tier 2
#### Inert Bomblet
Explosions scatter up to 3 (+2 per stack) bomblets, each dealing 75% TOTAL damage within 75% of the radius of the original explosion.
#### Jar of Medium Leeches
Gain 5% bleed chance. Bleed effects heal 1% (+1% per stack) health per 100% bleed damage dealt.
#### Refabricator
Repair up to 3 (+3 per stack) broken items on stage advance. May fail for rarer items.
### Void
#### Royal Tick
Gain 5% collapse chance. On Collapse, release a 10m (+5m per stack) healing burst that heals allies 1% (+1% per stack) health per 100% collapse damage dealt. Corrupts all Jars of Medium Leeches.

## Tier 3
#### My Manifesto
Explosions ignite for an additional 50% (+50% per stack) total damage. After igniting an enemy, gain 10% explosion radius until they stop burning, stacking up to 100% (+100% per stack).
#### North Star Hand Wraps
